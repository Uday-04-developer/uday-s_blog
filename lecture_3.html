    <h2 class="blog-title">My Second Blog Post - üîÅ The Power of Consistency</h2>
    <p class="blog-meta">Published on May 22, 2025 ‚Ä¢ By Uday Kelodiya</p>
    <p>
      Let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî staying consistent is hard. Especially when you‚Äôre a
      student, juggling assignments, projects, exams, and all the other chaos
      that comes with college life. I‚Äôve been there. Some days, you wake up
      ready to conquer the world. Other days, even opening your laptop feels
      like a task. But here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned: <b>consistency beats motivation
      every time.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      For me, it wasn‚Äôt some magical self-discipline formula. It was simple
      things ‚Äî reward myself when I completed a goal, and yes, sometimes punish
      myself when I didn‚Äôt (like skipping screen time or delaying a snack).
      These small tricks helped me build the habit. Over time, it stopped being
      a fight and started becoming a part of my lifestyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let‚Äôs face it ‚Äî studying is boring most of the time. Coding can get
      frustrating. Sitting through lectures you don‚Äôt care about feels
      pointless. But here‚Äôs the harsh truth: <b>if it were easy, everyone would be
      doing it.</b> Everyone would be employed, rich, successful, and happy. But
      they aren‚Äôt ‚Äî because it takes work. And you‚Äôre here, trying to do the
      work. That‚Äôs what makes you different.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don‚Äôt study because someone else told me to. I do it because I know <b>no
      one else is going to build my future for me.</b> If I slack off today, no one
      loses but me. If I stay consistent today, no one benefits more than me.
      That mindset keeps me going.
    </p>
    <p>
      You want to be known? You want respect? You want to build a name that
      lasts beyond college? <b>Then show up even when it‚Äôs boring. Especially when
      it‚Äôs boring.</b> Because that‚Äôs what separates you from the crowd.
